## Verified to work in Release
This project was derived from the vuejs project in [awesome-compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose)

Had to add a vue.config.js file that allows connections outside of localhost with `disableHostCheck: true`.

To make this project run in [Release](https://releaseapp.io), simply create a new application with this repository.
